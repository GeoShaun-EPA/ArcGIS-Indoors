#Data and Application Conventions

Space data at the EPA has developed in many disconnected silos among the various EPA regions and programs.  There is also a temporal aspect to this problem as space data formats have evolved from hardcopy drawings to 3D BIM that can be directly imported.  It is likely that the data uploaded from stakeholders will have its own local conventions for numbering rooms, naming spaces, and assigning uses to those spaces.  It is important that AGI be flexible to allow for local input while also being able to link multiple systems that contribute to an integrated view.  For this reason, the standard AGI fields will be supplemented with fields useful at EPA.  Domains will be used to constrain data to predetermined options to maintain clean records and make data entry easier.  Where possible, existing standards will be adopted and or adapted when defining data domains.
By default,  AGI has a hierarchical data model that allows the application to efficiently filter and search data.  Sites, facilities, levels, and units have IDs based on a nesting structure.  Each unit is on a level, each level is in a facility, and each facility is at a site.  This structure will act as a backbone for the application but may require modifications for local use.
