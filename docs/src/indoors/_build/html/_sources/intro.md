# ArcGIS Indoors at the EPA

The ArcGIS Indoors (AGI) program displays building floor plans in an online platform.  With the correct permissions, floor plans can be edited by local staff.  The floor plans are created using CAD.  The CAD data comes from local building facilities staff in the various regions and programs.  Because these data are often old and out of date, they require a substantial amount of cleaning before they are loaded using tools provided by Esri.    The AGI maps and applications are part of a larger GIS platform hosted at https://geosecure.epa.gov.  This geoplatform has to be accessed from the EPA network or if working remote, using the VPN.
As the NGST will be responsible for high level integration and maintenance of AGI, this document is being created to aggregate integration and operations information.  Where possible, it will reference existing documents produced by other groups that have the latest updates instead of reproducing quickly evolving processes.
